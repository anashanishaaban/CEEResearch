calculated with the value of the first parameter (in this
casetheequivalentfluidpressure)increasedbyonestan-
dard deviation from its best estimate value. F2 is the

factor of safety calculated with the value of the first pa-
rameter decreased by one standard deviation.
IncalculatingF1andF2,thevaluesofalloftheother

variables are kept at their most likely values.
The values of DF, DF, and DF are calculated by

varying the values of the other three variables (footing/
sand friction angle, backfill unit weight, and concrete
unit weight) by plus and minus one standard deviation
from their most likely values. The results of these cal-
culations are shown in Table 1.

using best estimate values for all of the parameters. For
this example, F = 1.50.

standard deviation of the factor of safety (s ) is found

4. With both F and V known, the probability of failure

and the reliability of the factor of safety can be deter-
mined using Table 2 or one of the methods describedin
Appendix I.Table 2 assumesalognormaldistributionof
factor of safety values, which is usually a reasonable
approximation.Thereisno‘‘proof’’thatfactorsofsafety
are lognormally distributed, but the writer believes that
it is a reasonable approximation.
The assumption of a lognormal distribution for factor

the same way.As discussed below, it is not necessaryto

"to be able to assess the reliability of F , as well as a best

estimate of its value.This can be done using theTaylorseries
method, which involves these steps:
1. Estimate the standard deviations of the quantities in-
volved in (1). Simple methods for estimating standard
deviations are discussed in the next section ofthepaper.
Using those methods, the following values of standard
deviation of the parameters involved in this example
have been estimated: s = standard deviation of the
efp
equivalent fluid pressure = 5 pcf (0.785 kN/m3); s =
tand
standard deviation of tan d = 0.05; s = standard de-
gbf
viation of the unit weight of backfill = 7 pcf (1.099 kN/
m3); and s = standard deviation of the unit weight of
gc
concrete = 2 pcf (0.314 kN/m3).
2. Use theTaylor series technique (Wolff 1994;U.S.Army
Corps of Engineers 1997, 1998) to estimatethestandard
deviation and the coefficient of variation ofthefactorof
safety using these formulas:",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
